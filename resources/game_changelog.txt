- Recoded HUD to display much faster than before (had to sacrifice visuals a bit). Should alleviate the bug that was causing some users to crash on startup, as well as a bug that caused extreme slowness of the game when loaded
- Added code for Skin Support (no UI for it yet)
- Added ExceptionDialog to display debugging information in JDialog to users. It should be displayed on non-fatal uncaught exceptions, as well as any exceptions handled through the handleException() methods
- Fixed a number of bugs related to HUD display
